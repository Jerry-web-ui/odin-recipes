           <h2>Kare Kare</h2> 
           <p>  is a traditional Filipino thick savoury peanut stew, accompanied by a vegan shrimp paste to bring it to the next level.Kare Kare is a traditional Filipino stew, commonly using different types of meats like oxtails and pork parts.  </p>
           <h3>Main Ingredients</h3> 
           <ul>
                <li><b>Banana Blossom</b> you can also get fresh banana hearts which is what I used in this recipe. They also sell canned banana blossom, which would be more convenient.</li>
                <li><b>Eggplants</b> a versatile vegetable used in Kare Kare</li>
                <li><b>Garlic Sprouts</b> we're using this in place of long string beans for more flavour but you can still use long spring beans!</li>
                <li><b>Bok Choy</b> you can use any other chinese greens if you are unable to find bok choy</li>
                <li><b>Protein</b> I used extra firm tofu and tempeh</li>
                <li><b>Rice Flour</b> I used rice flour from a pack for convenience but traditionally toasted rice flour is used</li>
                <li><b>Annatto Powder</b> to give the stew a brighter colour</li>
                <li><b>Ground Peanuts + Unsweetened Peanut Butter </b> form the signature flavours of this dish</li>
                <li><b>Vegan Fish Sauce</b></li>
                <li><b>Beef Boullion Cube</b> or vegetable stock cube</li>
                <li><b>Vegan Shrimp Paste </b></li>
           </ul>
           <h4>How to make it</h4> 
           <ol>
                <li>Chop your shallots and garlic finely. Slice eggplants and garlic sprouts in a 3-inch length, shred your banana blossoms and keep aside. Reserve some bok choy and garlic sprouts for serving later.</li>
                <li>Roast 3/4 cup peanuts and ground them into a fine powder.</li>
                <li>Fry your tofu and tempeh in some oil and keep them aside.</li>
                <li>Add some oil to a wok. Add shallots and fry until lightly brown. Then add minced garlic and saute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add eggplants and saute for 5-8 minutes until they are cooked. Halfway through, add banana blossoms.</li>
                <li>Once that's done, add garlic sprouts and saute for about 2 minutes. Remove the ingredients and keep them aside.</li>
                <li>To the same wok, add water, annatto powder and mix well. Add ground peanuts and peanut butter and combine well.</li>
                <li>Add vegan fish sauce, beef boullion cube and mix until combined. Mix rice flour in some water to create slurry and pour that in.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to boil as you keep stirring. It should become thicker.</li>
                <li>Add in your protein and vegetables back in. Lastly, add in your bok choy and mix until they become cooked (should take 1 minute).</li>
                <li>Mix in 2 tbsp vegan shrimp paste. Mix well and serve with blanched bok choy, stir fried garlic sprouts and a heaping spoon of vegan shrimp paste. Enjoy!</li>
